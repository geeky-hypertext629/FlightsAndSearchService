- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and install the following environment variables
    - `PORT=3000`
- Inside the `src/config` folder create a new file `config.json` and then add the following piece of json


```
{
  "development": {
    "username": <YOUR_DB_LOGIN_NAME>,
    "password": <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>,
    "database": "Flights_Search_DB_DEV",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

## Flights Table
- id -unique id to identify the flights

## Db Design
  - Airplane Table
  - Flight
  - City
  - Airport
  - City
// Different Services should have different databases

// Airplane Table
// ID --> Cannot be same for 2 planes
// model_no --> Can be same for multiple airplanes
// capacity
// created at
// updated at


//Flights
// Id
// src_airport_id
// dest_airport_id
// departure date
// arrival date
// departure time
// arrival time


//City
// id
// name


// Airport
// Id
// name
// city_id
// address


//  Entity Relationship diagram

//City ---> Airport

// Airplane --> Many Flights (one to many relation)

// One airport to many flights 

// one city to many airports

//Migrations help us to create incremental changes to our database

//All the interactions with the model should happen at the repository level
